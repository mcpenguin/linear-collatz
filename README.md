# Linear Collatz

The following code is a way to visualize "Linear Collatz" functions using the ```react-graph-vis```
React library, as described in the University of Waterloo's Pure Math Club Problem 4.

## Problem Description

A **linear Collatzian rule** is a piecewise linear function over the natural numbers
that looks like something like this: <br>
- kn -> n
- kn + 1 -> a_1(kn + 1) + b_1
- kn + 2 -> a_2(kn + 2) + b_2 <br><br>
